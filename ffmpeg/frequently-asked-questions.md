## What is video aspect ratio?

The aspect ratio of a video is the proportional relationship between its width and height. In other words, it is the ratio of the video's width to its height.

The aspect ratio is typically expressed as a pair of numbers separated by a colon, such as 4:3 or 16:9. The first number represents the width of the video, while the second number represents its height.

Aspect ratios can have a significant impact on the visual appearance of a video. For example, a video with a 4:3 aspect ratio will look more square, while a video with a 16:9 aspect ratio will look more rectangular. The choice of aspect ratio is often based on the intended use of the video, as well as the preferences of the creator.

Common aspect ratios for video include:

- 4:3 (standard definition)
- 16:9 (widescreen)
- 21:9 (ultra-wide)

It's important to note that the aspect ratio can affect the overall composition of a video, so it should be carefully considered during the planning and shooting stages of production. Additionally, when editing or converting video files, it may be necessary to adjust the aspect ratio to ensure that the final output looks correct on different devices or platforms.
